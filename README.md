JuniorGenius is a web app developed as part of my Master's project in Deep Learning subject. It uses HuggingFace NLP models to provide kids under 14 with personalized, educational, and age-appropriate answers to their questions. The goal is to create a safe, fun, and educational space that fosters curiosity and learning.
